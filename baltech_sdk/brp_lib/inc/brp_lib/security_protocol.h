 *  - **Replay protection**. Ensures that a man-in-the middle cannot resend

 *
 * This flag disables session key generation and continuous IV managing.
 * Thus no initial mutual authentication sequence is needed and the
 * communication is more robust, as no syncronisation of the session between
 * reader and host is needed.
 *
 * @attention Security is considerably reduced with this mode.
 *
 * @attention Running a command in a stateless protocol after a
 * stateful-protocol in the same security level will result in an
 * #BRP_ERR_COMMAND_DENIED.
 *
 * This mode can be combined with #BRP_SECMODE_PLAIN to deactivate encryption.
 * Otherwise encryption is active (i.e. #BRP_SECMODE_STATELESS is the same as
 * #BRP_SECMODE_STD|BRP_SECMODE_STATELESS)
